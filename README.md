# Network Hacking (wifi)

## Objective
Network Hacking and gaining access to WEP encryption networks and cracking them.

### Skills Learned

- Sniffing on 5Gz and 2.5Gz wireless networks
- aircrack-ng
  

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux.
- VMware Fusion.
- airodump-ng
- aircrack-ng

## Steps for WAP

- Changing the wireless USB mode to monitoring

The mode will be Monitor now
- Sniffing on 5G and 2.4G networks and find the network with the cipher WEP

- Wait for the #Data number to move real fast and open a new terminal window and ls to find the ".cap" file.
- Use aircrack-ng to find the Key
